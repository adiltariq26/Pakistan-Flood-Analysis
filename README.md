## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of flood data in Pakistan from **2001 to 2024**. The analysis identifies patterns, regional vulnerabilities, and historical trends to support better flood prediction and disaster management strategies.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- 📊 Analyze historical flood data patterns
- 🗺️ Identify regional vulnerabilities  
- 📈 Track impact trends over time
- 🔍 Detect outliers and extreme events
- 📉 Understand correlations between different impact metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 🔧 Data Processing

```python
# Data Cleaning & Transformation
hist_df = pd.read_csv("../data/historical_data.csv")
# Converted numeric columns to proper data types
# Handled missing values using reliable sources
# Cleaned and standardized regional data
```

### 📊 Analysis Features

1. **📅 Yearly Trend Analysis**
   - People affected trends (2001-2024)
   - Houses damaged over time
   - Fatalities analysis

2. **🗺️ Regional Analysis**
   - Impact distribution across provinces
   - Regional vulnerability assessment
   - Flood frequency by region

3. **📈 Statistical Analysis**
   - Correlation matrix between impact variables
   - Outlier detection using IQR method
   - Extreme value identification

4. **🔥 Worst-Case Analysis**
   - Top 5 most affected regions
   - Catastrophic event identification
   - High-impact flood patterns

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🌍 Overall Impact (2001-2024)
- **👥 77.3M+** People Affected
- **🏚️ 65.1M+** Houses Damaged  
- **⚰️ 10,246** Fatalities

### 🚨 Major Catastrophic Events
1. **2022 Superflood** - 33M people affected
2. **2010 Nationwide Flood** - 18M people affected  
3. **2011 Sindh Flood** - 5.4M people affected

### 🔗 Strong Correlations Found
- **People Affected ↔ Houses Damaged**: 0.90
- **People Affected ↔ Fatalities**: 0.81
- **Houses Damaged ↔ Fatalities**: 0.75

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

The analysis produces comprehensive visualizations including:

- 📈 **Multi-panel trend charts** showing yearly impacts
- 🏘️ **Regional impact bar charts** for comparative analysis  
- 🥧 **Flood distribution pie charts** by region
- 🔥 **Top worst regions** analysis charts
- 🔗 **Correlation heatmaps** and scatter plots
- 📊 **Box plots** for outlier detection

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Method 1: Using Conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate flood-analysis
